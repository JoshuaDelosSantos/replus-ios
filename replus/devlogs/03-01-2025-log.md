## Key Lessons
- Core Data.
    - Since it is a framework that relies on clasess (especially NSManagedObject).
    - Have to refactor my model structs into classes.

    - Core Data Model Classes Are Automatically Generated.
    - Turns out " you do not need to define the corresponding models manually in the Models directory, as Core Data will automatically generate the classes for you."
